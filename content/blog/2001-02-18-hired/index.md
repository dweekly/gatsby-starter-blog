I&#8217;m hired. I got a job at [Legato Systems][1]Â today. It&#8217;s a big company &#8211; a couple of thousand people. It looks like I&#8217;llÂ be one of their architects, helping them get a good vision for the futureÂ of backup and then helping them actually implement it. No, I won&#8217;t be ableÂ to tell you all everything that goes on there. ðŸ˜‰

It will be interesting being at a big company. Other than my work at MIT&#8217;s
  
Lincoln Labs, I&#8217;ve almost always worked in a startup-style environment, and
  
even at MIT, I was working as a &#8220;leaf&#8221; on the tree, free from having to deal
  
with any politicking or higher-level thinking. But in many ways, I find this
  
change attractive, because it will let me grow and understand how
  
larger corporations are structured. I plan to be at Legato for a while;
  
when I emerge, regardless of what I take on myself at that point, I&#8217;ll have a
  
firm understanding of larger-scale process.

One nice thing about working at a larger company will be that I will beÂ able to work on side projects at home and also work on buildingÂ [Hacker Dojo][2] version 2.0. (I&#8217;mÂ currently living in 1.0.) I will continue my off-work exploits and beÂ sure to post them here. ðŸ˜‰

One of the things that I&#8217;m honestly looking forward to most though is
  
culture hacking at Legato. By culture hacking, I mean changing the environment;
  
by changing people&#8217;s attitudes towards what can be done and what they can
  
expect out of their jobs. I&#8217;m looking forward to making Legato a really fun
  
and productive place to work. I&#8217;ve never been in an environment that felt so
  
ready for it: basically a bunch of smart people just waiting to have some
  
fun &#8212; asking for it explicitly, even. =)

I&#8217;m honestly just psyched to be working with a team of people on a regular
  
basis and to have some structure to my life to use as a platform for
  
world domination. =) In the interim, I&#8217;m learning Win32 as I contemplate
  
the possibility of getting a G4 when OS/X comes out so I can play with
  
such a pretty operating system that is actually Unix at its core.
  
[shudders in delight] I&#8217;m not a MacOS fan, but OS/X is starting to give
  
me tingles.
