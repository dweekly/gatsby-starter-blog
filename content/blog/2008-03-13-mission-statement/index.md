Who am I?
  
Who do I want to be?

<p class="MsoNormal">
  I want to create, explore, dream<br /> <span> </span>to add to the human experience<br /> <span> </span>to love and inspire<br /> and to give hope.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  I want to experience the human condition<br /> <span> </span><span> </span>and have friends from all walks, in all places.
</p>

I want to feel pain, sorrow, loss, delight,
  
  <span></span>eat the finest and coarsest cuisines

<p class="MsoNormal">
  I want to struggle and fail<br /> <span> </span>to love unrequited<br /> <span> </span>without becoming bitter.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  I want to see God in every face.
</p>
