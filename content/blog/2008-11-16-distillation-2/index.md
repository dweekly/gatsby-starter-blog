<p class="MsoNormal">
  The experience itself has a small value, providing tidbits to recall later context for other experiences.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  But raw experience cannot be shared effectively – the realtime essence of another consumes and overwhelms the viewer, requiring complete attention and subsumption into the experience of the other.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  So there is value in compressing the experience for digestion by others and truthfully most of the real-time is low bandwidth.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  One can have several different takes on this.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  One is to focus on making the realtime higher bandwidth, to have more vigorous adventures, to have deeper and more moving moments and interactions, to be – in a sense – living a movie.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  But this is too much for many.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Another is to consume compressed experiences, to read and listen to stories and process the concentrated essence of the lives of others.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Another option is to accept the low bandwidth nature of life.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Finally, a Zen option is to see that which already exists with in life and pay more attention to it, to perceive it in higher bandwidth.
