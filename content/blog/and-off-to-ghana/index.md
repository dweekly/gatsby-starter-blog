Oh boy. I&#8217;m two days away from hopping on a plane to Accra, Ghana toÂ go teach kids about science, technology, and the Internet. Much of ourÂ planning is very last minute as we&#8217;re trying to slap together aÂ curriculum, local sponsorship, etc. We&#8217;re planning on doing much of itÂ on the (loooong) flight over. It feels like the Greeks putting theirÂ stadia together at the last second! It worked out well for the Greeks,Â so I hope it works out well for us, too. On Saturday I got myÂ CPR/AED+First Aid certification from the Red Cross with my roommateÂ Chris; to celebrate, we watched &#8220;Hero&#8221; together, since we figuredÂ First Aid/CPR certification kind of makes us heroes of a lesserÂ sort. ğŸ™‚ Today, I was qualified to work as an Elections Inspector forÂ San Francisco in the November Presidential Election! Neat! This willÂ be my first &#8220;government job&#8221;. I even had to take a little test thatÂ made sure I could look up numbers in a table and add them up. It wasÂ easy, but somehow the thrill of passing a test never gets old. TheÂ company continues to go well, but I&#8217;ve been programming so much thatÂ my fingertips tingle all the time and my forearm is sore; I&#8217;m going toÂ need to get a wrist brace again to make sure I don&#8217;t literally code myÂ hands off. It&#8217;s rough business trying to take a tiny amount of moneyÂ and a handful of third-generation servers and turn it into anÂ architecture that can robustly support 100,000 simultaneous users. TheÂ good news there is that I&#8217;ve had a series of very positive meetingsÂ and partnership discussions that point to things likely going veryÂ well once we launch. Keep your fingers crossed for me! ğŸ™‚
