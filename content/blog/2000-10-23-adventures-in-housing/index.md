Whoo, boy. I just got housed! I hope to share with you some of the joy of finding a house in Silicon Valley here. =)

The short of it is that, yay!, my new address is

> 950 Pershing Avenue
  
> San Jose,
  
> CA 95126
  
> (408)998-8778

I&#8217;m pretty busy, though, so please don&#8217;t just call me randomly.

<hr align="center" width="60%" />

It all started out, strangely enough, with a [slashdot][1] thread. There was a slashdot post on [Constructing A Geek House][2] on September 20th. I [posted a reply][3], joking &#8220;What now, Personals?&#8221; and wondering if anyone had a place that I could stay at for a few months to a year. Surprisingly, I got quite a few responses, some on slashdot and some over email. One was from one of Cisco&#8217;s security folks, [Dan Kaminsky][4], who mentioned that he was planning to set up a Cisco house with other employees but that I was welcome to join in. After exploring a few other housing options, I decided that this was my best bet. Dan had found a Cisco intern by the name of Jason Abele and the three of us started looking for housing.

Now you&#8217;d think that three engineers with minimal living requirements and
  
decent salaries would be able to find a place to rent in a real jiffy, yes?
  
Well, not really. It took us around three weeks to finally find a place that
  
was near to Cisco, near to Caltrain, near to the airport, near enough to
  
the telephone company&#8217;s office to get high-speed DSL, had 3 bedrooms, and
  
was generally livable. Finally, we found one property managed by Cal-Western,
  
at 950 Pershing. We took it. Yay!

Figuring out net access was interesting (and it continues to pan out). As it turns out, we don&#8217;t really have cable modem access in our area, as [RCN][5] hasn&#8217;t really made it down here yet. DSL delays are now up to nearly 2 months, and we were desperate for some kind of fast netlink, so we had to find something else. [Satellite access][6] looked unwieldy and fixed wireless looked like it would take a few thousand bucks to set up and be unreliable. But much to our delight, we found out that [Sprint][7] was testing a [new fixed wireless Internet][8] deployment &#8211; $300 setup and $50/month for a 5 to 1.5 megabit downlink and 256kbps uplink. Not too shabby for something up and running in less than 5 business days! The engineer comes on Tuesday, so we should be nicely wired by Tuesday night.

We&#8217;re considering getting SDSL at some point (it seems that [speakeasy][9] is king in this world: 1.1/1.1 service for $200/month!) and maybe even [Sprint ION][10] (which gives you two phone lines with pimped-out options and a 8/1 megabit ADSL link for $120/mo), but this is largely dependant on how happy we are with the Sprint wireless broadband connection.

Interestingly enough, there&#8217;s actually a choice of power providers now in California! After some research, we&#8217;ll be getting our power from [Utility.com][11], which actually uses **only** renewable energy sources **and** costs less than the power from the [standard power provider][12]. Very cool.

Today (October 22) we raided Home Depot, Walgreens, and K-Mart for basic home furnishings. I&#8217;ve never been happier at a K-Mart: after quite a bit of shuffling around looking for home furnishings, I had been getting pretty depressed at how expensive it was to furnish a home. Then came K-Mart! Yay! I felt like I could suddenly afford things, like my spending power had been magnified by a factor of ten. It was a grand moment. =)

We&#8217;re still figuring out stuff like beds, though. Ack. New beds are expensive! ($1000 or so! ~$600 for a futon+frame!) We did get a massive (1000ft) spool of Cat5e Ethernet cable for the house, which we&#8217;ll probably lay in the next few days.

When we get broadband in here, one of the first things I&#8217;ll do is move the server here, which will mean that the website should get A) actually updated and B) will be faster.

Okay, it&#8217;s 4 in the morning, I&#8217;m sick, I&#8217;ve got hiccups, and the drugs I took to take care of the coughing aren&#8217;t working. Ack.

We rented a fridge, washer, dryer, and a queen-size bed (for me!). Yay!
