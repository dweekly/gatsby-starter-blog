In honor of [pi day][1] (3/14)&#8230;

If [pi][2] has an infinite number of digits in random sequence, then pi must contain all sequences.

It is commonly said that &#8220;pi does not repeat&#8221; and while generally true (pi does not predictably repeat) I think this assertion is clearly not strictly correct &#8211; there are an infinite number of repeated sequences in pi (e.g. &#8220;123123&#8221; occurs in the first million digits) as subsets of the sets of numbers in pi.

Therefore, I postulate that there exists at least one decimal position N in pi that is followed by the exact sequence of digits 1 to N-1. Namely, pi is &#8220;3.14159&#8230;314159..&#8221;. In regular expression syntax this question would actually just be phrased as /^([0-9]+){2}/, omitting the period after 3, naturally.

It should be provable that not only such an N exists but there is an infinite set of such repeating points. I would guess that that first N would be very large, maybe larger than the number of digits of pi yet computed ([in the trillions][3]), but if there is one there are almost assuredly an infinite number of other repeating points. This set would start with an almost improbably large number and I would suppose the numbers would very quickly get ridiculously larger.

There would be different such sets for different transcendentals, so perhaps we can discuss the creation of a function &#8220;D&#8221; that defines the infinite set of these &#8220;repeating points&#8221; for any transcendental. D(π) , D(e), D(φ), <strike>D(√2)</strike>, etc.
