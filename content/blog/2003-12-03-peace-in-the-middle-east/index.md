The middle east is pretty damn annoying. Specifically, the wholeÂ Israel / Palestine deal. I mean, it feels like there&#8217;s good evidenceÂ that there are a very large number of totally reasonable people onÂ both sides who are being totally ignored by a small number of
  
complete assholes.

Palestinians would like to be able to work in peaceÂ in their own country, make some money, and not worry about IsraeliÂ bulldozers smashing over their house in the middle of the night.

They don&#8217;t want to have to wade through five security checkpointsÂ just to go to work.
  
They&#8217;re happy to slice up Jerusalem however &#8211; they just want theÂ whole damn thing over so they can make some $bling$ $bling$. WarÂ sucks, and money is fun. Everyone understands that.

Israelis would like to be able to work in peace in their ownÂ country, make some money, and not worry about wacko terroristsÂ blowing themselves to bits on a bus or in a shopping mall.Â They don&#8217;t want to have to live in fear and terror of beingÂ in public places. **They** are happy to slice up JerusalemÂ however. **They** just want the whole damn thing over so they
  
can make some $bling$ $bling$.

The problem is the lame-ass Israeli hardliners and PalestinianÂ extremists. These violent psychos deserve each other but should notÂ continue to punish the innocent masses. In the same way that we&#8217;veÂ refused to support other terrorist regimes, the US must remove aidÂ from Israel until a moderate government willing to work with theÂ Palestinians is elected. Both Israeli militants and PalestinianÂ extremists are in gross violation of human rights. I don&#8217;t see howÂ one could reasonably be on any side of this horrorshow and I don&#8217;tÂ understand why the US feels such a need to appear to support theÂ Israeli hardliners. Thankfully, this trend is changing and weÂ ([and others][1])Â have begun chewing them out and even reducing their loans.

I pray for peace in the Middle East; for it to be a place of calmÂ and prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis alike. Two nationsÂ engaging in trade, two peoples living out their years as they please.Â Of both groups shooting about who should get all of Jerusalem, neitherÂ deserve any of it. May the meek (moderates) inherit the earth (orÂ at least, half of Jerusalem).

And for what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m very amused whenever the Pope gets upÂ and declares that there ought to be peace in the Middle East. As ifÂ a bunch of Jews and Muslims, slogging it out over their respectiveÂ holy lands are going to stop fighting because the head of the CatholicÂ Church asked them to. ğŸ™‚
