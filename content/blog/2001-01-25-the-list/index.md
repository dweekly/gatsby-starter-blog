I don&#8217;t know what pay ranges are like for any of these, so I can&#8217;t compare based on salaries yet.

**xDegrees**

> Pros &#8211; really intellectual environment, very smart people. A great learning opportunity and a clear chance for apprenticeship. Very difficult project. I would come out of this with god-like abilities.
  
> Cons &#8211; very dry. I would be the youngest there by a good margin for a while (2-3 months). I&#8217;d have to find a social environment orthogonal to work (maybe a plus?). Very intense (also maybe a plus?). Might not be fun. Questionable business model.

**Allibra**

> Pros &#8211; Fun people, good chemistry, neat product, definite profit potential for the company (gasp!). I&#8217;d get to learn Windows programming.
  
> Cons &#8211; Windows coding, ack! I would be one of the sharper people there. Potentially clueless CEO, although I&#8217;ll give him a second chance. Where does this take my career? Their demo didn&#8217;t work.

**Live365**

> Pros &#8211; potentially an excellent job doing a bit of business analysis combined with next-generation prototyping and hacking. Good chemistry, nice people, a field I&#8217;m comfortable with. Company on track to profitability.
  
> Cons &#8211; a little far away, although in reach of Caltrain. Have yet to do extensive interview with CTO, job offer not yet formalized.

**VA Linux**

> Pros &#8211; I&#8217;d get to be a genuine Linux hacker! Great company. I&#8217;d be helping to redefine the open source revolution and the future of how programming
  
> gets done (with SourceForge). Good people with good chemistry.
  
> Cons &#8211; not far away, but still a long commute, since it uses 880. Not related to online music space at all. I&#8217;d be primarily hacking, but with potential for consulting and architectural contributions.

**FileFish**

> Pros &#8211; a very small company (3 people) in which I could have a lot of sway over the future direction of the company. They&#8217;re well funded ($5m) and have an interesting problem. A real startup; they have a working demo! I had good chemistry with the people (all Stanford).
  
> Cons &#8211; The two co-founders are dating. This is odd. The problem they&#8217;re working on is useful to solve but won&#8217;t change the world, but it&#8217;ll probably make them some money.
