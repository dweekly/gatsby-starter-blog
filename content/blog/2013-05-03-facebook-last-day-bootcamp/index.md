9am, Facebook Headquarters: Cafe 18. My laptop is open next to a plate of kiwi and mango. It&#8217;s Friday and my last day of &#8220;bootcamp&#8221; at Facebook. Every person in the engineering organization &#8211; VP to fresh-outta-college &#8211; has to go through four to six weeks of fixing real bugs from all kinds of nooks and crannies of the product. I&#8217;d never done any Android programming at all but yesterday I had to figure out how to add a new feature to what might be the world&#8217;s most popular Android application. I was up until 1am getting it put together and then submitted my code for review. So I&#8217;m a little groggy.

Tomorrow morning I embark to Seoul where I&#8217;ll shortly be on stage in front of a few hundred developers explaining how to make their games more social. First, I&#8217;ll need to understand what the heck I&#8217;m talking about (eep). They really do throw you into the deep end here. Afterwards, I&#8217;m headed to Hong Kong, Taipei, and Manila to meet up with developers there. It&#8217;ll be very quick travel &#8211; I&#8217;m literally spending 20 hours in Manila, including sleep, but due to some lucky help from folks like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michellesantos" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=538680839">Michelle Santos</a> I&#8217;ll have a pretty packed itinerary to make best use of the time. And I&#8217;m packing some Ambien to catch some sleep on the plane.

    I&#8217;m excited and terrified and perhaps feel a little out of my league but maybe that&#8217;s just right. Here goes.
