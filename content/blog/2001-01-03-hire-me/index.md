I&#8217;ve been working at home for the last two months on my own projects and doing a little consulting on the side. It&#8217;s been okay&#8230;

Actually it hasn&#8217;t been. It&#8217;s been awful. I am a team player. I love
  
working with other people. I come alive when on a project with others,
  
but when I&#8217;m on my own, I flounder.

You see, when you have 90% of your time structured, intellectually
  
meandering with the remaining 10% is a lot of fun, and can be very
  
productive. But when you&#8217;re meandering 100% of the time, you just get
  
lost, tired, depressed, and very, very bored. Which is about where I
  
am right now. I need to be utilized. I need to be part of a team,
  
organizing things, engineering, designing, thinking, laughing with
  
others. So I&#8217;ve begun a job hunt.

I&#8217;m not sure what my long term vision for the future is, but I&#8217;d like
  
to at some point start my own incubator, codenamed &#8216;Coceve.&#8217; In line
  
with this, I&#8217;m going to need to find a good team of people and also
  
sharpen myself by being surrounded by brilliance. So I&#8217;m looking for
  
a fun, difficult engineering job within a reasonable commute from
  
San Jose, with a really good team, any size.

I program C, C++, Java, Perl, Lisp, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, PHP,
  
SQL, and just about anything else you want to throw at me. I do Linux,
  
have done MacOS, have written Win32 ditties, and have hacked on Solaris.
  
I write columns and analyses. I speak at conferences. I am your man.

If you&#8217;re working with a cool company, and you like what you
  
see on this site, here are some things to do:

  * [Read my resume][1] (or in [PDF][2] and [Word][3])

  * [Contact me
