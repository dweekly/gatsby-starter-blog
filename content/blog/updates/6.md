-----------------------------


-----<< CODEC COMPARISONS >>

I have reserved CodecReview.com and have begun work on
the backend database that will allow head-to-head
comparisons of various audio codecs. If you would like
to help with the encoding process (it's lengthy), I'd
much appreciate it, and you'd get prominently mentioned
in the credits. =)

EPAC is still in the works, but a deal is definitively
on its way. Lucent has had this locked up for the last
decade or so, so they're a little shy about releasing
samples so publicly, but rest assured, I'll break it to
you.


-----<< 1999 MP3 SUMMIT REPORT >>

I attended the 1999 MP3 Summit and came back with some
things to chew on:

-----<< COLLABORATIVE FILTERING >>

I think collaborative filtering is going to be key to the
future of the online audio industry. Read why:

-----<< SITE REDESIGN >>

I've settled on a new design for the site, which should
go into effect in the next few days, hopefully. Check it
out and tell me what you think.
