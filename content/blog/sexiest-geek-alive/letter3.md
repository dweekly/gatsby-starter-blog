Guess what? You've made it to the Sexiest Geek Alive Top 24!

We're hustling now to narrow it down to the Final 12. If you're selected, I will contact you by late afternoon tomorrow. Then Good Morning America will call you directly to arrange your travel to New York on Monday.

I would begin looking in to hotel and airfare to Austin for the March 14th Sexiest Geek Alive Pageant.

That Tuesday is the last day of the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Festival and the day before the SXSW Music Festival begins. Every year, over 900 bands from around the world, plus 3000 journalists and record label executives travel to Austin for this event.

That means hotel and plane tickets will tough. With hotel, you may have to resort to the outlying areas-Georgetown, Pflugerville, Manor, Buda, Round Rock. If you end up that far from the center of Austin, I will dispatch someone to pick you up, if necessary.

If you're in the Final 12, and finding a hotel is just impossible, contact me immediately and we'll figure something out.

Please know that you're all equally gifted and unique. If you're not selected for the Final 12, you will receive a special place on the GeekandGuru.com site as an Honorable Geek.

Thanks, good luck and feel free to contact me with any questions.
