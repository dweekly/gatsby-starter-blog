Okay, I&#8217;m **dying** over here. Just for fun a month ago, I saw a posting on a contest for the &#8220;Sexiest Geek Alive.&#8221; Giggling, I [went to their page][1] and [filled out an application][2]. I laughed and didn&#8217;t think about it again.

Then on February 20th, I got [this letter][3], which began with:

> `Congratulations! Out of 16,709 entrants to the "Sexiest Geek Alive Contest," you have been selected to be one of the Top 500 Sexiest Geeks. We had a difficult time choosing among the 8,742 men and 7,967 women who filled out our questionnaire...`

I laughed and sent the message to some of my friends and mentioned it on [my mailing list][4]. Two days later I was notified:

> `A reporter from Industry Standard may be contacting you about the Geek contest. We're narrowing the Top 500 down to a hundred and she wanted to interview my favorites. I added you to that list because I had read your <a href="http://www.playboy.com/oncampus/feature/mp3/weekly1.html">Playboy Online feature</a> and told her you were an "MP3 warrior."`

I started to wonder&#8230;sure enough, the next day (today; the 23rd), I received the [following letter][5], beginning with:

> `Congratulations again! You have made it on to the Top 100 of the Sexiest Geeks Alive.`

I&#8217;m not sure what to do at this point; I think it&#8217;s hysterically funny, but am not quite sure what to make of the whole ordeal. I&#8217;ll post more information here as it comes in&#8230;

<span style="color: red;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span> &#8212; Uh oh. I just got the [following letter][6], whose first paragraph reads:

> `Guess what? You've made it to the Sexiest Geek Alive Top 24!`

I&#8217;m a little nervous now. It was pure hysterics at being part of an anonymous top 500, but now it&#8217;s starting to get personal; if I am selected for the next round, it looks like they want me to go down to the South-by-Southwest (SXSW) festival in Texas mid-March. The main problem with that is that I have finals at about that time! Aie! Something in me hopes I don&#8217;t make it any further&#8230;

<span style="color: red;"><strong>UPDATE</strong></span> (@4:37pm 2/25/00) I&#8217;ve dropped out of the contest for personal reasons and while I was told that I had made it to the next round (top 12), I would have had to have gone to Texas in the middle of finals week.
