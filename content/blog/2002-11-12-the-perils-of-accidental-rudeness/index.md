Just now, I did something horribly mean. I ignored a nice person on AIM that was having a delightful chat with me. And \*BAM\*, I ignored them, never to see a message from them again. I rebooted my computer and any and all traces of them were removed.

The saddest part of this all is that I didn&#8217;t mean to do it. My computer crashed after she first IMmed me, and when I brought a second computer up, the dialog that says &#8220;Do you want to accept a new message from \___\___?&#8221; appeared with a default of &#8220;NO&#8221;. I happened to just be hitting a carriage return at the precise moment the dialog appeared. PAF! She&#8217;s gone. Now I have no way to contact her and she, understandably, likely feels pretty miffed&#8230;rebuffed and rebuked even. Why do computers make it so easy to be mean by accident?

Just last week, I was playing a certain online game, and I said something cheeky &#8211; one of the people took it the wrong way and moved to slap me; but when I tried to indicate an apology and to &#8220;cancel&#8221; the slap, the game had my character slap the other back and get into a fight. This highly exacerbated an already delicate situation and quickly made me some online enemies.

Technology is a lubricant for social interaction; programs and telecommunications links make it easy for people to communicate around the world, instantaneously. Unfortunately, they often make it just as easy to communicate in a positive fashion as in a negative one.

The problem with this is that negative messages come across far more strongly than positive ones. You&#8217;ll remember someone who says &#8220;you are a loser&#8221; a lot longer than someone who says &#8220;you are nice&#8221;. But if in an imaginary user interface the two buttons were next to each other, iconified as a smiley and a frowny face, both equally easy to press, it&#8217;s a pretty fair bet that you&#8217;d accidentally send negative messages to people when you didn&#8217;t mean to do so.

In real life, we&#8217;ve got lots of natural reflexes that help us be kind, or at least appear kind. When people smile, we usually can&#8217;t help but smile. When they laugh, we find ourselves laughing. When someone look at you, you feel the desire to look, even if just for a moment, back in their eyes. These reflexes are not commuted online. Instead, when someone types a smiley, you have to actively type a smiley back &#8211; the absence of doing so may connote rudeness.

As consequence, online is perhaps by default a neutral medium, whereas real life is more of a positive medium. This difference makes it all the easier to interpret online actions as rude or even hostile when a similar conversation, had in person, would never have resulted in a similar outcome.

Or maybe online is worse than neutral; what if it is downright inherently cruel? Anyone who has experienced an IM friend suddenly disappearing or getting disconnected at &#8220;inopportune&#8221; moments will know what I&#8217;m talking about; it&#8217;s as if someone had just walked away from you as you were mid-sentence, or, in the latter case, slammed the door in your face.

You&#8217;d think that, taking both the human sensitivity to negativeness and the default meanness of online communication, that the tools would be made to make &#8220;friendly&#8221; the obvious default, so much so that cruelty would need special and mildly obscure menu items and keypresses and, when engaged, would pop up a little message saying &#8220;Are you sure you want to do this? It might be considered mean,&#8221; with NO as the default.
