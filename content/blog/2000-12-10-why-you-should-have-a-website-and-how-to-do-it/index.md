**You** should have a website. You have something to share that only you can share,
  
something that other people can enjoy, learn from, and be entertained by: your life.

Most people that I tell this to laugh and tell me that they can&#8217;t think
  
of anything to put on a website. This is because a lot of the personal
  
webpages out there aren&#8217;t very helpful or even very interesting: some
  
poorly designed page with blinking tags and silly animations with very
  
little to say and a few pictures of dogs and cats and the webmaster at
  
various parties. Most people are afraid of falling into this mode, and
  
justifiably so.

But most people don&#8217;t realize the really great stuff that they have to
  
share: it&#8217;s not (necessarily) their pictures of their dog or their cat
  
or what kind of ice cream they like: most people who don&#8217;t know you
  
really don&#8217;t care and can&#8217;t get anything out of that. Instead, think
  
back on the things that you have done. Maybe you&#8217;ve written poetry
  
about your garden. Maybe you&#8217;ve done some pencilled sketches of a
  
tree-filled horizon. Maybe you play a little guitar on the side. Maybe
  
you&#8217;ve picked up a thing or two about carpentry. All of these things
  
represent valuable contributions that you could make to the rest of
  
mankind.

Share them! Type in your poems! Borrow a friend&#8217;s scanner to scan in
  
your pictures and paintings and sketches &#8212; and record that groovy guitar
  
lick you just came up with. Write a little piece on the correct way
  
to dovetail on a clothes bureau or that nifty recipe you have for walnut
  
cookies.

Now putting it on a website doesn&#8217;t mean it will be read by millions.
  
Maybe only a handful of people will, and most of those even will be
  
your friends and family. but in the process of realizing what you have
  
to share and expressing that, you will have enriched yourself. And those
  
handful of people who came to your page will be that much more edified
  
about the world. And who knows? Maybe your page **will** be read by
  
thousands of people a day! But don&#8217;t start with this mentality or you&#8217;ll
  
get caught up in the (false) enormity of it all.

So now I hope I&#8217;ve got you pumped up to make a page. How should you
  
go about doing it?
