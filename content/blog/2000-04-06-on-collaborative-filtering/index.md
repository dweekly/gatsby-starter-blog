A recent set of technologies have been devised to help websites learn
  
about their users and take intelligent actions accordingly. These
  
technologies, called &#8220;recommendation engines&#8221; or &#8220;collaborative
  
filtering,&#8221; examine a user&#8217;s past viewing habits and compare them with
  
other users who have similar interests. If your interests were found
  
to parallel another group of users, then the system could start making
  
suggestions: suppose you normally never listened to any country music,
  
but you liked bands X, Y, and Z, a whole lot. Now if a whole bunch of
  
other people who don&#8217;t normally like country and also like X, Y, and Z
  
suddenly all are listening to (and loving) this one country band, the
  
system might suggest it to you and be relatively confident that you&#8217;ll
  
like it.

This technology is neither brand new or obscure: Amazon.com uses it
  
extensively on their website to recommend books to buyers. Indeed,
  
Firefly applied recommendation engine technology to CD purchases on
  
the web many years ago. Unfortunately for them, they took too long to
  
license out their technology (they wanted to be the only people on the
  
&#8216;Net with that technology) and were subsequently steamrolled over as
  
companies like Net Perceptions came to market swiftly with
  
sophisticated engines. Microsoft quietly picked Firefly off with what
  
was rumored to be a humiliatingly cheap acquisition.

But the fact that no online digital music providers have yet to openly
  
embrace this technology seems surprising to me: this technology is
  
absolutely key to the success of online audio. Why? Because new
  
publishing and distribution infrastructures will make it very easy for
  
artists to publish profusely on the web. Like the 500-channel
  
television, the diversity of content is appreciated, but the sheer
  
quantity of music on the Net could prove so overwhelming as to
  
discourage listeners (and potential buyers) from seeking out the music
  
they would enjoy. Techie geeks refer to this as &#8220;the signal-to-noise
  
ratio problem:&#8221; if you only hear one band you like (signal) for every
  
twenty you don&#8217;t (noise), you won&#8217;t want to spend your time poking
  
around for that one band.

The record industry had a fairly effective technique for increasing
  
the signal-to-noise ratio for music: the original point of those
  
practicing A&R, or &#8220;Artists and Repertoire,&#8221; at record labels was to
  
seek out the good bands that the majority of the population would
  
enjoy. But the Internet offers us what no A&R man could &#8211; the
  
potential for individuals to have access to the bands they love both
  
big and small, from all around the world. Recommendation engines make
  
this possible, and reduce the signal-to-noise ratio by presenting
  
music that, based on your prior listening tastes, you&#8217;re likely to
  
enjoy.

Ultimately, this obviates A&R: once somebody has heard a band that she
  
deems pleasant to listen to, it will be recommended to those of
  
similar taste &#8211; if they like it, it may get recommended to their
  
friends, etc. In this way, the popularity of music is decided on more
  
by the taste of the people than the marketing push of a major label. A
  
small folk artist in Oklahoma could become vastly popular in Northern
  
India; who knows? Everybody benefits from this technology: artists,
  
who get better exposure; consumers, who hear more music that they
  
enjoy; and sites, which have more satisfied customers than before.

To date, people have argued that online audio sites have not yet
  
adopted this technology because of a paucity of content: when there
  
are only 15 artists on a site, a recommendation engine is hardly
  
appropriate. But with the rising tide of acceptance of online
  
distribution, floods of artists have been flocking to centralized
  
music portals like eMusic, MP3.Com, and Audio Explosion. This newfound
  
influx has left the sites unable to provide tasteful experiences for
  
their users, leaving them instead awash in a flow of &#8220;exotic&#8221; (to
  
phrase it kindly) amateur music from around the world. They have
  
reached the size and maturity to move to collaborative filtering.

And move they must: the stakes are large in this brave new world and
  
the listeners plentiful. The winners will quickly adopt and manage
  
these new technologies, and those less nimble will be left wondering
  
why more people didn&#8217;t come listen to their 15,000 artists.
