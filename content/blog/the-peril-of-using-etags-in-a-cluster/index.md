Apache administrators: beware ETags if you have more than one webserver! (If you only have one webserver this article will not be useful to you.)

HTTP/1.1 added the header response &#8220;ETag&#8221; to allow a server to defineÂ its own way of uniquely identifying a point-in-time version of a specificÂ file. The ETag is unstructured data; it&#8217;s just a string.Â The client, when rerequesting a document, submits an &#8220;If-None-Match&#8221;
  
header &#8211; if this header does not match the server&#8217;s ETag for the file, theÂ server **must** retransmit the document, even if the HTTP/1.0Â &#8220;If-Last-Modified&#8221; header exactly matches the &#8220;Last-Modified&#8221; date of theÂ file.

This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad as-is if it weren&#8217;t for the way that Apache implementsÂ ETag support by default. The default setting is to incorporate the file&#8217;sÂ last modification date, its current size, and its Unix inode. The first twoÂ make sense; I can understand wanting to make sure that both the last-modifiedÂ time and the size match what&#8217;s on the client. But incorporating the inode leads to some very bad behavior on clusters, because a given file,
  
such as LOGO.JPG might have the same size and modification time on all ofÂ the webservers of the cluster, _**but the inode numbers are guaranteed toÂ be different**_.

This means that if you have four web servers, three times out of four whenÂ a client connects to a random web server, the client&#8217;s stored ETag will notÂ match the server&#8217;s and the server will needlessly be forced to retransmitÂ the file to the client. As the number of web servers grows, the situationÂ quickly approaches the point where effectively no caching is happening atÂ all.

This is all compounded by a bug that I found in Internet Explorer 5 and 6,Â where if the downloaded file&#8217;s Last-Modified header matches theÂ If-Last-Modified header it sent in the request, IE **doesn&#8217;t bother toÂ update its cached ETag**. This means that even if you were to force IE to keep connecting to the same server (with the same inode for the file, etc.),Â once it&#8217;s made up its mind about an ETag it won&#8217;t change it until theÂ Last-Modified time changes!

To fix this insanity, stick the following line in your Apache httpd.conf:

<pre>FileETag MTime Size</pre>

This will tell Apache to construct ETags based on only the modificationÂ time and the filesize; specifically, it prevents Apache from using theÂ inode of the file in the ETag. Then touch all of your files to update yourÂ last-modified time. The next time a client goes to your page, they&#8217;llÂ re-download the files, since the last-modified time changed, but thenÂ they will have the &#8220;simplified&#8221; ETag (without an inode) and they won&#8217;t haveÂ to download the file again until the file actually next changes. Your pagesÂ will be much snappier! ðŸ™‚
