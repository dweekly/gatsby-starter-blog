So I&#8217;m writing this from a computer lab in Accra; it&#8217;s nicely modern, with about 50 pentium 4-2000 machines, but it&#8217;s about 1500ms to anything really interesting on the Internet backbone and the speed&#8217;s not that fabulous. But it works! And while we were hoping to have 50 students for the camp, it looks like we actually got more like 150 applicants; so we&#8217;re actually having to select which student we&#8217;ll take, which is bittersweet. The plane flights over were pretty brutal; a 10 hour flight from SFO to Amsterdam and a six and a half hour to Accra. I woke up this morning at four AM local time (having gone to bed at midnight) and was \*wide\* awake. Now it&#8217;s 11am local and I&#8217;m feeling like I need to sleep some more. It&#8217;s kind of wacky. We&#8217;ll be working on setting up the camp&#8217;s curriculum and so forth; the camp starts Monday! Keep your fingers crossed for us. People are friendly,
  
the city is insane with traffic and potholes and vendors and goats (more on that later; the sounds, colors, vistas, and smells are a real symphony of the senses. It&#8217;s an intense experience. I&#8217;m taking pictures &#8211; can&#8217;t upload them yet but I&#8217;ll post as soon as I can.
