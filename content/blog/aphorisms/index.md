Just for the sheer, unadulterated hell of it, I&#8217;ll put some aphorisms of mine here. They may alternately amuse, disgust, or bore you.

  * You may measure twice before cutting once, but if you cut too fast, you&#8217;ll still chop off your thumb.
  * In life, choose a path to take and GO; the simpleton who stays at the intersection, awed at the number of choices, does nothing.

  * Never wish to have someone else&#8217;s life. You have no idea what it&#8217;s like, and once you&#8217;re there, you probably would want to go back.

  * If you find yourself saying, &#8220;Ah, I could never do that,&#8221; slap yourself and just go do it. It&#8217;s your life &#8211; live it with authority.

  * No matter how much fun work is, friends are your number one priority.

  * Money is meaningless. You will find yourself denying your soul as you deny this statement.

  * Open as many doors as possible for yourself, but don&#8217;t forget all of the ones you&#8217;ve opened &#8212; maybe after you get your PhD you really do want to work as a garbageman. Do it!

  * Find people who stimulate you and make you feel alive. Hang out with them often. Find others like that.

  * Dance yourself stupid.

  * Always assume other people are intelligent and likeable. Make them have to work hard to negate this assertion. Without faith in the human race, you will lead a very miserable life.

  * 100% of all relationships either end in a breakup or death. So if you&#8217;re single, don&#8217;t pine too much to be in one. Just enjoy.

  * Go light on the liquor. In the long run, it&#8217;ll only make your life more depressing and less significant.

  * Caffeine is the only mind-altering drug worth taking on a regular basis. =)
