On September 22nd, 2007, I got together with several of my friends (Eve Phillips, Jocelyn Joy Berl, Travis Kalanick, Nathan Schmidt, and Alan Keefer) and with the inspiration of my brother [Chris Weekly][1] we tasted a number of beers and rated them, along with commentary. They&#8217;re ranked here from top scoring to bottom scoring as averaged by all six individual scores. All scores are on a scale of 10.

Boddington&#8217;s (7.6)
  
&#8211; smooth, creamy, balanced
  
&#8211; i love it, wow
  
&#8211; it&#8217;s got &#8220;twang&#8221;
  
&#8211; clean finish, doesn&#8217;t linger
  
&#8211; quickly drinkable, goes down fast
  
&#8211; classically styled

Smithwick&#8217;s (7.1)
  
&#8211; very full-bodied, smooth beer
  
&#8211; mature, nothing up front, everything on the back end
  
&#8211; the trojan horse of beers
  
&#8211; almost &#8220;woodsy&#8221; not quite &#8220;floury&#8221;

Hen&#8217;s Tooth (6.6)
  
&#8211; malty musky
  
&#8211; bitter, sour, strong, &#8220;leather and coffee&#8221;
  
&#8211; could drink some amount of it

St. Peter&#8217;s Golden Ale (6.5)
  
&#8211; hoppy head, barley ass
  
&#8211; a little honeyed
  
&#8211; burnt toast, lingering
  
&#8211; a long finish
  
&#8211; citrusy like a bitter orange

St. Peter&#8217;s English Ale (6.0)
  
&#8211; hoppy, tart, smooth/subtle
  
&#8211; bready, easy to drink

Murphy&#8217;s Irish Red \[in glass\] (5.8)
  
&#8211; lacking in personality
  
&#8211; &#8220;the guy with pec implants&#8221;
  
&#8211; not at all what i would expect from an &#8220;irish red&#8221;,
  
this is an &#8220;irish pink&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;almost great&#8230;but it misses&#8221;
  
&#8211; got a little &#8220;snap&#8221; to it
  
&#8211; sourdoughy, herby, tart, &#8220;sunny like a picnic&#8221;
  
&#8211; good picnic beer, cheerful / inoffensive
  
&#8211; &#8220;let&#8217;s play some volleyball&#8221;

Hobgoblin \[wychwood brewery\] (5.0)
  
&#8211; fruity, citrusy, &#8220;early bitterball&#8221;, a &#8220;clean exit&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;this is almost a fruit juice&#8221;
  
&#8211; heavy, but doesn&#8217;t stick around
  
&#8211; wouldn&#8217;t want to drink a lot of it, &#8220;4 oz and i&#8217;m done&#8221;

Killian&#8217;s (5.0)
  
&#8211; transition beer from &#8220;not beer to beer&#8221;
  
&#8211; musty, &#8220;horsey&#8221;, &#8220;hay, urine, and dust&#8221;
  
&#8211; sparkly, not a lot of taste, bland
  
&#8211; &#8220;would not call in the morning&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;meh&#8221;
  
&#8211; olivey
  
&#8211; a &#8220;bar beer&#8221;, &#8220;not a gourmet beer&#8221;
  
&#8211; velvety, soft, a little fruity / apple juice

Miller Lite (3.8)
  
&#8211; &#8220;club soda redone as beer&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;it&#8217;s really nothing&#8221;
  
&#8211; inoffensive, simple
  
&#8211; watery
  
&#8211; &#8220;an inch and a half of roots showing&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;trailer trash beer&#8221;

Belhaven &#8220;Wee Heavy&#8221; (3.4)
  
&#8211; nice color
  
&#8211; &#8220;something is wrong with this beer&#8221;
  
&#8211; eve WINCED &#8211; bitter & chocolatey &#8220;like a triple boch&#8221;
  
&#8211; rancid chocolate
  
&#8211; &#8220;it smells of feet&#8230;and not my feet&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;over the top on every category&#8221;
  
&#8211; &#8220;italian chimay&#8221;
  
&#8211; strong attitude
  
&#8211; sweet, bitter, sour vanilla with chocolate
  
&#8211; &#8220;bridge and tunnel&#8221;
