In the coming days, the now-familiar &#8220;frozen&#8221; sign should be disappearing from the site. That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m [back][1] and I&#8217;ve got an itching to do some cool things with this site.

The simplest changes will be the usual ones: I hope to start regularly
  
writing essays again and posting them on my main page. I may also experiment
  
with some layout and organizational changes that will make it easier for
  
people to read my website on low-end browsers (Palm VII, Omnisky, WAP,
  
AvantGo, etc.) and that will make it easier for me to publish and edit
  
content. Don&#8217;t worry though, my site probably won&#8217;t look much different,
  
there won&#8217;t be graphics, and the page should stay fast-loading on a 14.4k
  
modem.

Once I get a house all set up and we&#8217;ve got high-speed networking installed,
  
I&#8217;ll probably host my server there (right now, the kind folks at [iomojo][2] are hosting it out of the
  
goodness of their hearts!), which will allow me to do all sorts of trippy
  
server-side stuff (hopefully). It will also let me bring back the now-broken
  
links to the actual audio samples on my [codec review][3] section.

I&#8217;ll keep you all posted as I roll out modifications! Among other things, look
  
for upcoming articles on peer-to-peer networking and my trip to Europe! =)
