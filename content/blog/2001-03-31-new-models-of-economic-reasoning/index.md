_intro_
  
This discussion is consequent to a discussion I had two nights ago with my two [roomates][1]:
  
[Dan][2] and [Jay][3]. I&#8217;m writing this while a little drunk, after having had an absolutely incredible day at Tom Pepper&#8217;s house.

**_premise_**
  
American society is designed to make people unhappy. People who are
  
content don&#8217;t feel compelled to work 16-hour workdays.
  
People who are happy with their lives don&#8217;t feel the inherent need
  
to spend every last dollar on some fleeting consumable to make them
  
feel like they are &#8220;good people.&#8221; While no evil mastermind is behind
  
the plans, Americans are being engineered to be pretty miserable.

They are not being engineered to be **completely miserable** because
  
complete misery inspires a certain apathetic despair that doesn&#8217;t
  
boost the economy at all. Instead, the ideal is to have you at the
  
point where you are at the edge of losing hope, where you are desperately
  
willing to try anything to infuse your life with a little meaning. Where
  
you are willing to honestly consider that maybe a shade redder of
  
lipstick \*will\* make you attractive enough to catch that man who will
  
finally bring happiness and meaning in your life; where that extra 50
  
horsepower really \*will\* make you feel like a man and feel like life is
  
complete.

Happy people just want some food, some shelter, and a great deal of
  
company. Once they have this base level of sustenance met, they can
  
pursue their inner happiness without a great deal of concern for
  
other material goods. They find their happiness in existance and in
  
sharing life with the people around them. A nation full of happy
  
people is a nation full of people who don&#8217;t need goods to fulfill
  
them.
