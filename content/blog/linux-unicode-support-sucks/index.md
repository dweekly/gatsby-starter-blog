[Unicode][1] is just about theÂ coolest thing since sliced bread. It&#8217;s the kind of thing afterÂ which you wonder how things possibly worked previously. The ideaÂ is simple: one character set can represent any character in anyÂ language. There are a few different ways of encoding UnicodeÂ characters (there are more than 100,000 of them!) but the mostÂ popular is &#8220;UTF-8&#8221; for the 8-bit Unicode transfer format.

UTF-8 is not-very-coincidentally also a superset of 7-bit ASCII,Â meaning that most English documents are already valid UTF-8.Â The algorithms for dealing with UTF-8 are not overly complex &#8211;Â while characters are multibyte, the leading bits actually tellÂ you what bit you&#8217;re on, so character counting is easy and doesÂ not require the insane juggling of some of the Asian characterÂ encoding techniques to find out where you are in a string.

Windows 2000 & XP (and indeed, even NT!) seem to have prettyÂ decent Unicode support. Internet Explorer lets me read UTF-8Â pages just fine, including posting mixed Chinese & Hebrew commentsÂ on websites. ðŸ™‚ I can cut and paste between Notepad and IE without
  
difficulty. Yay!

There was one minor quirk, and that was that IE basically seemed toÂ ignore the META tag on a website (specifying that a page was encodedÂ in UTF-8) if there was a Content-Type header from the server thatÂ contradicted it. So I needed to explicitly set the Content-Type
  
header to **Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8**. Then everythingÂ seemed to render alright.

So I flip on over to Linux to see what the currentÂ state of the international toolchain is, figuring it&#8217;s probablyÂ going to be incredibly robust, since, what, theÂ [whole ofÂ China][2] is basically using Linux, right? Wrong. Hardly anythingÂ worked.

To be fair, I first needed to configure my Windows SSH clientÂ ([PuTTY][3])Â to &#8220;assume&#8221; that the character encoding it was being fed was UTF-8;Â unfortunately, it seems that terminal protocols don&#8217;t have a goodÂ mechanism for indicating the client or server&#8217;s capacity for variousÂ encoding techniques. So I also need to set the **LANG** environment variable
  
to **en_US.UTF-8** from its default of **en_US**.Â This still wasn&#8217;t enough.

To get [lynx][4] (the terminal webÂ browser) to work properly I needed to call it with **&#8211;display_charset=utf-8**. I finally saw Chinese over SSH. Yay.

I looked at quite a few editors (Emacs, Vim, Xemacs, QEmacs, and mined)Â of which only mined seemed to support UTF-8 editing in any sort ofÂ reasonable capacity. The next version of Emacs promises &#8220;real UTF-8Â support&#8221;, but I seem to recall hearing those sorts of promises lastÂ year, too. I&#8217;m frankly distressed. Thankfully the basic tools likeÂ **less** seem to be fully UTF-8 compliant. Odd.

Anyhow, more rant later. ðŸ™‚
