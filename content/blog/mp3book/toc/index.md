_Back in early 2000 I was approached by a publisher to write a book about about MP3 audio technology; I only wrote the first two chapters
before my senior project duties eclipsed book-writing and I needed to shelve the project indefinitely. 20 years
later, in 2020, I've resurrected what I had written and am re-publishing it._
