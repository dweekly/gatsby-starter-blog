I&#8217;m at &#8220;Busy Internet&#8221; in Accra right now. We&#8217;ve been calling theÂ people who did and didn&#8217;t manage to make the program. It seems thatÂ instead of taking 50 kids, we&#8217;re going to try and take 100 kids, doingÂ two sessions a day. Clara had indicated that we&#8217;d be &#8220;totally fried&#8221;Â trying to do just 50 kids, so God only knows how intense this upcomingÂ week will be. It sounds like I&#8217;m going to be doing the technologyÂ teaching, so I have to prep for doing four presentations a day (!) forÂ Monday-Friday. Thankfully, we did manage to find a local sponsor forÂ our lunch money, so the kids will be able to eat.

One thing that really amazes me here is that even though most of the streets are dirt
  
(and all are unlit) and everything&#8217;s a hodge-podge insanity, a fullÂ THIRD of the local businesses are computer-related; either offering ITÂ classes, Internet access, computer repairs, computer sales, etc. TheseÂ people are clearly stoked for computing, which is a tremendousÂ boon. Teaching people who want to learn is a bajillion times easierÂ than trying to persuade folks that they want to learn.

The food isÂ really good; I was honestly a little worried, since I had neverÂ sampled Ghanaian fare, but the sauces, plantains, etc, are all veryÂ yummy. It&#8217;s pretty funny being the only white guy around. I thinkÂ everyone should go somewhere where they&#8217;re a stranger &#8211; it helps giveÂ you perspective on strangers in your own land.

Everyone has cellÂ phones and TVs. As might be expected, labor and food are much cheaperÂ than the US; gas is about the same price in $US and electronics areÂ considerably more expensive. Taxis, surprisingly, are \*everywhere\* andÂ are at least as common as cars. The taxis are uniformly inÂ just-about-to-fall-apart condition, with seats tipping as you sit
  
down, doors mostly-closing, and the exteriors having clearly enduredÂ more than a few dozen knockups. It seems that everyone is sellingÂ everything by the streets &#8211; coffins appropriately intermix withÂ motorcylces on roadside displays, and throngs of men and womenÂ approach the car to knock on the glass and present everything from theÂ daily paper to hubcaps to chewing gum to yams. Some of the moreÂ entreprising streetsalesmen tape their product to themselves; one manÂ approached our car with a tie freshly fronted by taped-on GilletteÂ razor blades. There are a wide variety of streetside stalls hastilyÂ erected wherever a wide-enough sidewalk permits. Measuring about threeÂ or four feet per side, you can buy phone cards, questionably freshÂ fish, cooked meals, or even haircuts in these little huts. SeveralÂ have dire warnings spraypainted on by the police about when the hutsÂ must be removed.

I&#8217;m very happy to be here and I hope we can make aÂ difference. These people want to learn about technology and we want toÂ teach it, so it feels like a match. ğŸ™‚ Keep your fingers crossed forÂ us (or pray, if you do that). We need it.
