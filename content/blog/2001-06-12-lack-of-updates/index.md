There have been a definite lack of updates to my website over the last half year (early 2001-mid 2001). Some of you have been asking about this. Why have I slacked on posting? It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m going through some very painful and wildly confusing personal bits, and some of the parties involved happen to read my website. (One even asked to have access to my website blocked.)

Mostly, it&#8217;s because I feel like I have nothing useful to say these days; with my mind full of these personal issues, there has been less room for ideas, essays, and creativity. While it is true that sad people can produce some of the best artistic works, I think that happy people think best and most clearly. At the very least, such seems the case for me.

So I&#8217;m just going to try to keep on living and to heal and some day actually remember what it&#8217;s like to live life full of joy, enthusiasm, and optimism. I think I&#8217;ve lost a lot of that along the way. To what and how, I&#8217;m not sure. I think it&#8217;s just part of the natural process of life unless it&#8217;s radically countered. (It&#8217;s fantastic and inspiring to meet individuals leading such
  
uncorrupted lives; I am no longer one of them.)

In the meantime, for those of you who have noticed, I have been periodically updating the pictures section. I hope to put in a new engine for displaying and navigating pictures before long. If you [bug me][1] I&#8217;ll probably get it done faster. =)

Finally, if you want to hang out or chill and grab a meal, go running, or go for a swim, please tell me. I could use a little friendship. Because for the interim I&#8217;ve been disabused of notions of love and romance and perhaps would like something on the order of camraderie to replace them.
