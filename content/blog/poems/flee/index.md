_"Flee, flee! Run for your lives!"_

how much we would all like to flee  
this grim reality,  
these strange set of experiences  
in this odd world.  

sick and twisted are not they  
but we.  
sad to understand that "all men" falling short  
incudes me.  

running, running, running.  
but who do we flee?  
are we really separate from  
sin?  

wind rushing through my hair  
as i run far away from...  

me
