feet, those strange estranged things on the ends of ones legs  
i love them  
many people think that feet are digusting gross things  
but i love them  

feet show the marks of where one has been  
of where one is  
of where one is going  

feet not eyes are the markers of the human soul  
eyes show what a person wants  
feet show what a person does.
