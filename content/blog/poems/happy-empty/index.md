she had a wonderful smile  
(yes everyone said it was beautiful)  
and she was always laughing  
(a smile on our lips)  
but somehow  
beneath that  
cheery face  
there was pain.  

pain in the thoughtless laughter  
character in the mindless banter  
love in the friendly impartiality shown to all she knew.  

there was a hole  
that she tried to fill  
with making other people happy  
but somehow  
it was always there  
black  
(gaping)  
empty  
(hurting)  
huge.  

her insides  
no different  
than ours.
