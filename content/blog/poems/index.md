These are some old poems from high school and early college days (1994-1998) that I only recently (2020) managed to recover, thanks to the Internet archive.

They aren't necessarily very good or a great reflection as to who I am today, but they're a glimpse into the kind of nerdy, hubristic, mildly angsty kid I was as a teenager.
