Wrinkles are good.  
I like bumps.  
Coarseness makes things real.  
Things that are scratchy are realistic; nothing real is smooth.  
Life is thick, chewy and bumpy, like a good steak  
it waits, dripping, for us to bite deep into it.  
You can hold on to things that have texture.  
You can identify things that have texture.  
The things in life that give us pain, that give us bumps also give us identity.  
They give us meaning.  
They give us reality.
