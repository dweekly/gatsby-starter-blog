beautiful aging one  
i stare at the wrinkles  
on your hand.  
nervously  
you laugh

"Isn't it ugly?"  
no mother  
i think to myself  
it is beautiful.

it is beautiful like you.  
it is beautiful like your age.

cheese wine humans become better with age  
giving them a distinctive touch  
a personality  
wisdom knowledge beauty too.

why so hated, age?  
the young, bold and brash denounce you  
but foolishly  
for will not they  
like their elders  
grow old?

perhaps oldfashioned  
outdated people  
will save the world  
one of these days.

save it from the stupidity of young beauty  
and young insolence  
and educate us all  
in the beauty of age.
