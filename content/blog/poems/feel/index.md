i feel

a little dead lately,  
like i'm missing the point in a lecture.

someone is telling me their life story,  
but i am not listening.  
my eyes glisten over.

selfish, greedy bastard i am.  
where did all this hatred come from?

where did the impatience, the greed, the lust, the evil come from?


i said goodbye to god a while ago.  
god wanted to be my friend,  
but i think i must have bored him off  
as i was talking one day about how great i was  
and about how all of my thoughts were so interesting  
he just left.

he had some things to say to me,  
but i couldn't listen  
since i was so busy talking.

and i've been trying to explain life and computers  
to the people who should have been teaching me.  
i manage to maybe help my elders along,  
when all the while they were trying to help me.


at the slightest word of criticism,  
i turn around and recoil,  
packing all of my offenses to defend my every action:  
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY THINK THAT I AM WRONG!

...without even trying to consider  
the possibility that they have something to say.


I am pure!  
I am all powerful!  
Bow down, ye gods, before me!

(cries the little boy in the wilderness)


I smite all those who would oppose me  
cast aside those who love me  
spend my days immersed in knowledge  
knowledge that does not lead to wisdom.

And I spend my days as a fool,  
the blind leading the blind.

an antichrist for the new world order  
another hypocrite in cyberspace.
