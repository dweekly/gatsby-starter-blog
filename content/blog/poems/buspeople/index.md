buspeople superbusy have to  
stop  
for a moment on the bus.  
they cannot cut in line while sitting,  
cannot increase their wealth,  
cannot move up the ladder  
of socio-economic wealth.  
so, poor people, what must they do but

stop  
and stare out the window at the life  
they are so speedily passing by.
