love is  
so much like code

a crude analogy perhaps,  
but to the programmer  
as to the romancer  
no greater highs come when all works together  
and no greater lows can be found with the error

debugging is no fun,  
no fun at all.

but the bugs happen with real code,  
with difficult challenges.  
the only way to guarantee the absence of bugs  
is not to code at all;  
but skill does increase with experience,  
and a seasoned love-hacker may be born out of the persistance of his vision.

further yet the challenges of love,  
for like a bad pointer bug,  
it is non-deterministic.  
fate and action combine to produce what is experienced;  
but perhaps the same can be said for the insights acheived and lost  
on the bloody fields of code.

nobody knows when inspiration will strike.  
nobody knows whence love will spring.
