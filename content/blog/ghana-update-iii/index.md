Busy Internet strikes again. Internet here is 12,000 cedis per hour. The exchange rate is (very roughly) 10,000 cedis per dollar. (It&#8217;s actually more like 9k and change) So that&#8217;s around $1.25/hour, which isn&#8217;t so bad and certinaly doesn&#8217;t seem so punishing that it&#8217;s keeping locals away &#8211; this place is busy and provides Internet, so no false advertising there. The bills start at 1000 cedis, or about ten cents; this means that when you get a $20 changed for a stack of 5000-cedi bills you feel RICH, which is fun; I&#8217;ll be kinda sad to not walking around with a huge fistful of money. ðŸ™‚

We start the camp tomorrow; I&#8217;m excited. We&#8217;ve finally got the basics of our curriculum picked out and we grabbed some more volunteers from church (yeah, I was the only non-black person attending), so we&#8217;re up to around 20 volunteers for 100 kids. Pravda and BoingBoing have posted our press release, and we&#8217;ve got interest from several other news organizations &#8211; more press will definitely help us out with fundraising and finding volunteers for next year.

I definitely get the sense that Ghana is a very entrepreneurial country &#8211; there are almost more startups than in Silicon Valley! Everyone has a little hut-business. The cultural intermix here is pretty funny, too. Korean trucks driving by Indian restaurants blasting American hiphop &#8211; and trashy English-redubbed Spanish soap operas are all the rage, despite the fact that there are basically no hispanics here. If there are one or two, they&#8217;re good at hiding.

Had goat for lunch; I guess I can check off another animal. My favorite is still moosemeat, which I had in Quebec; tasty stuff, that. It&#8217;s odd, because the smells from the cooking are actually not that pleasant, but I find the meals quite tasty.

Driving, or being driven, is basically an exercise in your faith in God. Everyone drives very quickly, doesn&#8217;t pay attention to vagaries such as &#8220;the correct side of the road&#8221; or &#8220;stop signs&#8221; and the roads themselves are full of fun surprises like giant potholes. Only the most major of roads are paved and street addresses basically don&#8217;t mean anything &#8211; people use PO Boxes for everything.

Getting out the camera was very funny; a crew of soccer players getting out from practice spotted me riding in the back of a truck with my camera and started cheering and posing when they saw me taking pictures of them. It was getting dark, though, so I&#8217;m not sure the picture came out.

Anyhow, all is well, I&#8217;m off to prep the last parts of the lesson plan for tomorrow. Please wish me luck! Hugs to all!
