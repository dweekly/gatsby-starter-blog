[One month ago][1], we started working on our newest idea, connecting extended families through sharing. We’re now proud to announce the name for our endeavor: [Oha.na][2].

Ohana is Hawai’ian for “family”. Indeed, anyone who’s watched Lilo & Stich will be familiar with the concept. We want to make it easier for extended families that are geographically spread to be closer together by sharing photos, videos, updates, and gifts with each other.

We’re about to enter extreme early alpha in the coming week or so. If you’d like to try it out, please tweet at us! 🙂
