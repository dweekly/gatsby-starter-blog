Bjoern Lasse Herrmann and Aleksandra Markova describe the Atherton, CA based incubator-house they live in (called Blackbox.vc), how it sprung out of a global network of youth entrepreneurs called Sandbox, and how a young, rural German came to meet a young, rural Russian somewhere in Washington thanks to a U.S. Government program.
