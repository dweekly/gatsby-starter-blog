My (now former) roommate Ulrich describes his epic road trip from California down to the southern tip of Chile in his trusty Jeep, with a kayak mounted to his roof. The trip took over four years and included a three month pit-stop in Guatamala (&#8220;an excellent place to learn Spanish&#8221;) and six months in Panama, where Ulrich now owns a small retreat center / compound.
