David Weekly interviews James Halliday and Peteris Krumins, the CEO and CTO (respectively) of the newly-established Browserling, a browser testing firm in which David made his first angel investment. (The interview was done a mere hour after closing the round!) James describes his drive down from Alaska to the Bay Area to pursue funding for his startup and Peteris describes his childhood with computers in Latvia and his meeting James on IRC.
