I had a weird experience today chatting with a hacker on ICQ who had taken over my friend&#8217;s account. The conversation&#8217;s too weird to have made up:

* * *

<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â David do you want a digital copy of PC Magazine?
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â ?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Who such, why in a cap, why without a cap?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â russian joke
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â er&#8230;i&#8217;m not sure i get it.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Read the alphabet Study to think on russian
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â This isn&#8217;t Phantom Joe, is it.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â why are you hacking his account?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â because I am russian HACKER
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â you are lame
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â you&#8217;re just being rude, not cool.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â it&#8217;s not like ICQ account-nabbing is difficult, either.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â ???? i\` dont understend you
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â you&#8217;ve gone and messed up this poor guy&#8217;s account
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â he&#8217;s a nice guy &#8211; an australian.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â i\`m badboy from odessa
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Terribly?
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â no, but he&#8217;s had to go sign up for a new account and try to remember all of his friends&#8217; UINs. it&#8217;s just a pain, that&#8217;s all.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â there are much cooler ways to use your talents.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â you live in Odessa?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â yes
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â that would make you a Ukranian hacker, not a Russian hacker. ðŸ˜‰
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â In soul I russian !! Odessa only there is on Ukraine and city this Russian
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Well what was frightened?
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â frightened?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Fright
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â who is frightened?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â you
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â of what?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â because I Ukranian HACKER
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â [sigh]
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â absolutely shaking, yes.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â truth be told, i think you are a little kid who is just desperately trying to impress others.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â you&#8217;re talking with me because you&#8217;ve got nothing better to do with your time.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â i think you should just hand the account back over to my friend and put yourself to productive use.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Fuck OFF
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â i&#8217;m sorry, child.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â get a job.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â there are better ways to make money and friends.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â work isnt wolf In a wood will not escape
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â eh?
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â _[russian text]_
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â i&#8217;m sorry, but my client doesn&#8217;t display Russian, nor do I understand Russian.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â Search the interpreter
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â i&#8217;m sorry, but i&#8217;m at work and am a little busy.
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â i do hope you&#8217;ll use your talents in a more productive fashion
  
<span style="color: red;">Think:</span>Â than annoying nice people that you don&#8217;t know.
  
<span style="color: blue;">343907:</span>Â ok
