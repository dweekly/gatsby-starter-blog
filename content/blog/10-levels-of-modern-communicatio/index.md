My coworker [JoÃ«l][1] and I were today discussing the different ways we can communicate and how &#8220;serious&#8221; each was. From lightest-weight / most innocuous to most intimate and serious, we came up with the following:

  1. Facebook poke, friending someone on Facebook
  2. Twitter @person, Facebook wall post or picture comment, MySpace comment
  3. Twitter direct message, Facebook message, MySpace message
  4. Instant message
  5. Email
  6. SMS / phone text message
  7. Attending the same event
  8. A phone or Skype conversation
  9. Meeting one-on-one
 10. Handwriting a letter

  This is hopefully a helpful guide for people deciding how meaningful a communication with another person is. It&#8217;s sorted almost directly by emotional weight as well as exposure and intimacy with the other &#8211; for instance, knowing someone&#8217;s handle doesn&#8217;t expose much, but their phone number is a more personal thing (and harder to control), and a home address even more so.

  It&#8217;s amazing to me that handwritten letters are effectively the most esteemed and valuable forms of communication to our generation. I probably receive a full handwritten letter in the mail about once every other year and it&#8217;s always a profound experience. In high school, I&#8217;d send and receive several a week.

  It may be an interesting reflection to note that I can barely write legibly and my hand cramps now after about a paragraph. I just never use those pen muscles anymore.
