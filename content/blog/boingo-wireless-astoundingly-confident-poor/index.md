When I was stuck in Boston&#8217;s Logan International Airport for a few hours waiting for a flight, I decided I ought to get some work done; I popped open my laptop to see if I could spot a free network. Signed onto &#8220;loganwifi&#8221; and got a page full of ads asking me to pay for access via Boingo Wireless. At $10/mo ($22/mo after the first 3) and 100,000 access points, I decided I might give it a whirl and plopped down my card. Things were smooth, but then it wanted me to download a Windows program. Ruh-roh. (I&#8217;m just connecting to wifi! Why do I need another resident program?) So I go ahead and install it and run it. It thinks for two minutes about logging in and then gives me a &#8220;999 Network Error&#8221; and a phone number for support. Here&#8217;s where things get good.

I connected with support relatively quickly, and the guy sounded educated and confident in his answers, but I was shocked at the things he said:

&#8220;Are you recharging right now? Yes? Then I&#8217;d recommend you unplug and move a few feet away. I know the signal strength says 77%, but that really doesn&#8217;t mean much. Most people I talk with who are having connection issues are recharging, you know.&#8221;

&#8220;Did you download the program with Firefox? Firefox sometimes has an issue with these wireless networks and the installed program might be corrupted, which could be causing the &#8216;999 Network Error&#8217;. Try downloading the program again with IE.&#8221;

&#8220;Okay, just go to Boingo and log in again&#8230;&#8221; (I log in and the website refreshes for several minutes saying &#8220;Now Loading Account Information&#8221; and then gave up.)

&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re using a Core 2 processor with Boingo? You know, that just doesn&#8217;t work, **the signal bounces back and forth between the two processors** and so some locations you just can&#8217;t connect.&#8221;

I started yelling at him and eventually got a refund. [smacks head]

It was amazing how confident this guy was. I probably wouldn&#8217;t have known how nuts this guy was if I wasnt&#8217; a computer scientist myself.
