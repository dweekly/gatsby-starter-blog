In this talk for [StartupMonthly][1]&#8216;s Demo Day I outline the analogies between hacking together software (not the malicious sort!) and hacking/founding companies.

The rundown? You need to just start, even though the road is tough and even though the beginnings may be humble. Find and keep good people everywhere you go. Know what you&#8217;re good at and not and find people to fill the holes in your capabilities. Don&#8217;t try to hide/protect your ideas &#8211; keep an idea board around. Don&#8217;t build technology for technology&#8217;s sake. Don&#8217;t get too caught up in the details and avoid moving forward (&#8220;bikeshedding&#8221;). Stay close to the money and only raise VC if it&#8217;s compatible with where you want to take your business.
