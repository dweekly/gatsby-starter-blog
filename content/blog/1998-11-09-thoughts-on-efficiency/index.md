[a story for you]

As Tzu-Gung was traveling through the regions north of
  
the river Han, he saw an old man working in his vegetable
  
garden. He had dug an irrigation ditch. The man would
  
descend into a well, fetch up a vessel of water in his arms
  
and pour it out into a ditch. While his efforts were
  
tremendous the results appeared to be very meager.

Tzu-Gung said, &#8220;There is a way whereby you can irrigate
  
a hundred ditches in one day, and whereby you can do
  
much with little effort. Would you not like to hear of it?&#8221;

Then the gardener stood up, looked at him and said, &#8220;And
  
what would that be?&#8221;

Tzu-Gung replied, &#8220;You take a wooden lever, weighted at
  
the back and light in front. In this way you can bring up
  
water so quickly that it gushes out. This is called a
  
draw-well.&#8221;

Then anger rose up in the old man&#8217;s face, and he said,
  
&#8220;I have heard my teacher say that whoever uses machines
  
does all his work like a machine. He who does his work like
  
a machine grows a heart like a machine, and he who carries
  
the heart of a machine in his breast loses his simplicity. He
  
who has lost his simplicity becomes unsure in the strivings of
  
his soul. Uncertainty in the strivings of the soul is something
  
which does not agree with honest sense. It is not that I do
  
not know of such things; I am ashamed to use them.&#8221;

[my thoughts]

Efficiency has been the modern mantra. It is more important than love,
  
more important than family, and more important than friends. We
  
adhere to it for the its excitement, for the rapidity which which
  
it brings us capital, and for the capable of providing more
  
material goods for the common man. To oppose inefficiency, to run
  
counter to the flow of technology is tantamount to sin.

For the last century (arguably two centuries), this efficiency has been in the form of big business. We have relentlessly struggled with the morality of &#8220;working for The Man,&#8221; especially in the sixties and seventies. It is easy to hate large corporations as it is easy to hate the rich and those in power. But there is a new class of proclaimers of efficiency rising in our midst. And it is not in the form of big business, but of individuals themselves: the free source community.

Why do they/we do this? Why should we take it upon ourselves to more
  
efficiently destroy the foundations of humanity than even those before
  
us? The answer seems to be that we have finally believed the myth of
  
the corporation: that efficiency \*is\* good, and is a valid thing to
  
strive for. The Open Source community was a natural extension of society
  
finally embracing the propaganda of efficiency. We joyfully welcome Big
  
Brother with shouts of adulation now; we crack the whip upon our own
  
backs. There is no need for a tyrant, no need to have some outside
  
oppressing force when we can do the job so much more effectively. We
  
will efficiently maximize our destruction through efficiency, carried
  
out cleanly, happily, and without waste. A fitting end. One that we wish
  
to participate in?

Any technology not aimed at making Man better, at encouraging him to
  
enjoy life and make friends will do nothing but crush the life out of
  
us; even those that are so geared are not guaranteed to succeed, and
  
may backfire horribly: there was a tribe in Africa where one would
  
light a fire after having sex, always. This helped keep adultery in
  
check, because you&#8217;d have to go to your neighbor&#8217;s house for a light
  
to light the fire after the deed, and, well, everyone would know then.
  
Separately, Europeans came with information on health, agriculture,
  
etc. They happened to bring matches. Think about it.

If a good percentage of those without technology are sociable, happy,
  
and down-to-earth, what end does technology bring us to? Why do we
  
pursue something that makes us stressed, nervous, and unhappy? Why do
  
we strive to make more intense the very things that cause us angst?
  
We know from the lesson of time that we will not have less things to
  
do &#8212; we will have a little bit more and four times the responsibility,
  
twice the people connected to us to be upset when only three times the
  
things we did before we get done. We will be a little more alienated
  
from our fellow humans, a little less comfortable with our humanity, a
  
little less content, a little less impressed by reality, a lot more
  
stressed, and our &#8220;Quality of Life&#8221; will go up at the expense of the
  
real quality of our lives.

Technology is neat. It is fun. It is shiny. Just like the guidance
  
systems on ICBMs. It is compelling, intense, and exciting. It can be
  
pretty, &#8220;pur-ple,&#8221; pay well, and come with Mountain Dew. We jump up
  
and down, code, design, engineer, and implement, all with friends,
  
relatives, co-workers and elders encouraging us, cheering us on as
  
we change the world and make Big Names for ourselves. But what are
  
we doing? Is this \*good\*?

If it is not, stop. No amount of Mountain Dew, cash, or encouragement
  
should be able to compensate us for destroying humanity. We must find
  
positive ways to use technology, if there are any. (I hope there are.)
  
My justification for Start^2 is that it will get people off the

computer, to see each other, network people, let people enjoy life. I
  
see this as sufficient justification. It is an &#8220;anti-technology&#8221; as it
  
were, encouraging people to use technology less. Not a sticky portal,
  
but the very opposite: a \*boot\* portal to give you a solid kick in the
  
ass: HEREQUIKTHISISWHATISGOINGONNOWGOAWAY! I don&#8217;t want you to linger.
  
Go outside, here&#8217;s the weather, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on. Have fun.

This is a fundamental difference between what I want to do and the new
  
Net-communities run by Excite, Dejanews, etc&#8230;I want everyone to use
  
my site, stop using other sites very much, and stop randomly surfing
  
the Net and start talking to their neighbors. I failed to point that
  
out last night, mainly because I am just now realizing our goal&#8230;
