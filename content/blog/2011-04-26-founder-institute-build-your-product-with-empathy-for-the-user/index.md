This recorded talk comes courtesy [The Founder Institute][1], where I am a mentor.

Many products fail to gain user adoption because they are built from the perspective of a technologist with unnecessary complexities. As I explain in the video below, it’s important to “make the main thing people do with your product as simple as possible” to attract users and give them a feeling of confidence.

In this talk from 2011&#8217;s San Francisco Founder Institute, I explain that you need to build products with empathy for the user to create something that resonates. I discuss minimalist design, how to make complex functionality discoverable, efficient product development, and user experience considerations.
