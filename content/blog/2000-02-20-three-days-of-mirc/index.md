While spending a weekend at [Hopkins Marine Station][1], where [my girlfriend][2] is studying this quarter (it&#8217;s a [bit of a drive][3]!), I was introduced to [Rurouni Kenshin][4], an **incredible** anime series. The weird part was that we didn&#8217;t watch the episodes on a TV. We watched them on her housemate&#8217;s computer.

When I asked to see his collection, he showed me something on the order of 100 CD-Rs, each of which contained 12 anime episodes. It blew my mind. He told me that he had got all of this with late-night sessions with [Mirc][5], an IRC chat client. I returned home that week, determined to see what I could find.

I installed Mirc, and spent that day checking out the networks. You see, with IRC, groups of servers are clustered together over the Internet. If you connect to any server in a given cluster, you can talk with anyone who&#8217;s connected to any other server in that cluster. Each of the major server clusters has different rules and runs different server software. The one that I found to have the most people and information was [DALnet][6].

On the DALnet anime channels (just look for channels containing the word &#8220;anime&#8221;), I saw several chat bots: participants that weren&#8217;t people, but intelligent scripts, periodically posting information as to what kind of files they had available, a &#8220;trigger&#8221;, and how many people were currently downloading files from them. They all were using an Mirc script known as [Polaris][7], which helps you set up and run a file server. At any rate, when you&#8217;d see a server that looked like it might contain some interesting files (like, say, the first year of episodes of some anime series), you&#8217;d type in `<strong>!<em>trigger</em></strong>` &#8211; if the trigger was `luv that anime`, then you&#8217;d type `<strong>!luv that anime</strong>` &#8211; kapiche?

The chat server would then request a DCC (Direct Client-to-Client, namely a conversation going directly between you two instead of through the IRC servers) Chat session with you, at which point you are presented with a DOS like interface to the server&#8217;s files. You can type &#8220;dir&#8221; to list the files in a direction, &#8220;cd&#8221; to different directories, etc. The other interesting commands are `get <em>filename</em>`, which requests a given file; `sends`, which shows what other clients the server is currently sending files to; and `queues`, which shows the users that are queued up to grab files after the sends complete. If the queue is full, you can&#8217;t request files any more. You&#8217;ll have to find another server.

After another day of lurking around on these channels, I scored several Kenshin episodes, [Princess Mononoke][8], a Japanese subtitled version of [American Beauty][9], and the first year of[Ranma 1/2][10] (a story about a guy who can change into a girl; some fascinating gender commentary!).

I setup Polaris on my own (it was a little complicated!) and started serving on those channels. I was instantly noticed by an IRC bot on the channel who upped my status to &#8220;+v&#8221; (voice mode), and several people messaged me to ask to exchange other files. I only ran the server for an hour and a half, after which I saw that I had transferred over a gigabyte of information from my computer to other people. Wow.

I was amazed by the sheer quantity of video content available on IRC. Napster is great for audio, but I had generally assumed that it would be very difficult to find video content; my excursions with [Hotline][11] had not been very successful; the servers all wanted me to join porno mailing lists just to access their content (this is how they&#8217;d make money!), but I obviously didn&#8217;t want to sign up for porn spam! I also have issues with people profiting / restricting access to the distribution of material that they obtained for free.

Although the initial learning curve is a bit steep (people aren&#8217;t happy if you take up too much of their time or say stupid things on a channel), within 3 days I went from never having used Mirc to being an active server on the network with several hundred megabytes of files for trade. It&#8217;s pretty amazing what&#8217;s out there; IRC has been around for decades. If agencies think that by shutting down Napster they can control the distribution of information, they haven&#8217;t even begun to see the tip of the iceberg.
